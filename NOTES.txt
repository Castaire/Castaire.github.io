>> SORTING OPTIONS :
	- sort by date (default; newest first)

	- sort by type 
		. miscellaneous (small notes / reminders / thoughts ???)
		. projects
		. blog posts 	(none so far, LOL)

		(^ each block type should be displayed with a different color)

	- sort by alphabetical order

>> BOARD NOTE object values:
	- type { miscellaneous, project, block post }
	- name 
	- date

	> each board note should be a link that either points to a project page on 
		GitHub or a small single-page post in a separate url

>> BOARD NOTE design: 
	- title -> name
	- 

>> DESIGN notes:
	- simple fixed-position drop-down in upper-right corner to filter out the
		notes on the board

	- ^ maybe a color-coded tick-box? 

	- maybe an extra page that shows a timeline overview?
		*** do this after writing initial page ***

>> MISC:
- <p class="hidden">hey brah</p> 
	.hidden {
		display: none;
		type: hidden;
	}

	^ hides text / stuff without allocating space

- TODO: we probably want to use fixed-size for page sections
